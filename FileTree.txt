- Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) :- Designed to be used by Unix distribution developers. It is to reference to it.
1. root dir :- Everything exists on linux system is found below it
2. Binary directories
- /bin :- contains binaries for use by all users. Contains commands like cat,cp, date, echo, grep
- other /bin :- This can be user specific /home/shubham/bin
- /sbin :- contains binaries to configure the OS
- /lib :- Binaries found in /bin and /sbin often use shared lib located in /lib. 
- /opt :- To store optional software
3. Configuration directories
- /boot :- Contains all files needed to boot computer. /boot/grub/grub.cfg file defines boot menu that is displayed before kernel starts
- /etc :- Contains all machine specific configuration files (Editable Text Configuration). 
4. Data Directories
- /home :- To store personal/project data of users (/home/$user). Also stores user profiles
- /srv :- Used for the data that is served by your system
- /media :- Mount point for removable media devices such as CD-ROM's, digital cameras, usb. 
- /mnt :- This should be empty and to be used for temporary mount points
- /tmp :- to store temporary data when needed. This data stored may use either disk space or RAM.
5. In memory directories
- /dev :- Device files in /dev appear to be ordinary but are not actually located on hard disk
- /dev/null :- Unlimited storage but nothing can be retrieved from it. Anything written here is discarded (used to discard unwanted output from commands)
- /proc :- proc filesystem. /proc/cpuinfo gives info about cpu
- /proc/interrupts :- displays the interrupts
6. /usr (Unix System Resources)
- /usr/bin :- contains lot of vcommands
- /usr/include :- contains general use files for C
- /usr/lib :- contains libraries not directly executed by users or scripts
- /usr/local :- used by admin to install software locally
- /usr/share :- contains architecture independent data
- /usr/src :- location for kernel source files
- 
7. /var Variable Data
- Files which're unpredictable in size such as log, cache and spool file are located in /var
- /var/log :- central point to contain all log files
- /var/log/messages :- troubleshooting file. This file contains info on what happened to system
- /var/cache :- contain cache data for several apps
- /var/spool :- contains spool directories for mail and cron. Also is a parent dir for other spool files
- /var/lib :- contains app state information
